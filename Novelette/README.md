## Background

This was the final project for Bellevue College Music 210. The idea
was to modulate through all key signatures, with half as minor keys. The
first four keys are the four keys used in "My Graduation" by Ijichi
Hiromasa. Given that the goal was to include all requirements of the
assignment and to try to make the result as smooth and coherent as
possible.

The title derives from my original misunderstanding that Poulenc's
Novelette in C was almost entirely not in C and just forced into C at
the very end.
