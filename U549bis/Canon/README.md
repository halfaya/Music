## Background

Assignment for Bellevue College Music 211.

I was particularly
intrigued by the 12 second "Untitled piece for strings in D major,
U. 549 (fragment)" on the fantastic recording [Arnold Schoenberg:
Early and Unknown String
Works](https://www.amazon.com/Early-String-Works-Arnold-Schoenberg/dp/B000LXIMYM).
I transcribed the [autograph](../MS91_U549bis.jpg) (my
[transcription](../U549bis.pdf) may contain errors); the recording
only encompasses the first three bars but I also included the
incomplete fourth bar.

For class we were to write a three-voice canon, and it seemed this
fragment would lend itself to that. I made two versions, one using
only material from the fragment with just a few changed notes for
smoothness. The second version was more freely adapted to be more
consonant on downbeats. It resolves to B minor rather than D
major. The second version (as a single-line) is what was submitted.
