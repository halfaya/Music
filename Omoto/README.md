## Background

This was a composition assignment for Bellevue College Music
212. We were to write a Debussy-style impressionistic piece with a
choice of scales and chord types. The idea behind this piece is that
the pianist is supposed to play an ostinato that the other players
improvise on, but he continues to modify it with the goal of reaching
the Ryukyu scale, at which point the piece ends.
