# Four Paths to Freedom

## Files

For each piece a MuseScore source file is provided (X.mscz), a PDF
score (X.pdf) and possibly an MP3 sound file (X.mp3).

1. *Star Spangled Banner*. Original song with lyrics and
   harmonization.
2. *Four Paths to Freedom*. Arrangement and reharmonization for string
   quartet.

## Idea

The musical idea is that each instrument attempts to follow its own
path, but is subject to contraints by the others.

1. **Violin I** plays the melody of the Star Spangled Banner.
2. **Violin II** plays free counterpoint against the main melody.
3. **Viola** attempts to fit the other three parts together making some
   kind of harmonic sense.
4. **Cello** plays the root of the original harmonic progression.
