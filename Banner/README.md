# Four Paths to Freedom

The musical idea is that each instrument attempts to follow its own
path, but is subject to contraints by the others.

1. Violin I plays the melody of the Star Spangled Banner.
2. Vionin II plays free counterpoint against the main melody.
3. Viola attempts to fit the other three parts together making some
   kind of harmonic sense.
4. Cello plays the root of the original harmonic progression.
