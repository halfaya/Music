## Background

This was a composition assignment for Bellevue College Music
212. It is based on the all-interval tetrachord 0146. Inspired by
Schoenberg's Opus 24 Serenade and Act 3 Scene 3 of Berg's Wozzeck, the
idea was to explore atonality in the context of dance rhythms. After
an introduction, the forms used are the waltz, cha-cha, and
salsa. Rebeca Mauleon's "Salsa Guidebook" and "101 Montunos" were
valuable references. The song title is from "Salsa Caliente del Japan"
by Orchestra de la Luz.
