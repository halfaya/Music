## Background

This was the a composition assignment for Bellevue College Music
211. We were to write five variations given a theme, and one of the
choices was [Carol of the
Bells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_of_the_Bells), a favorite
Christmas song, which was actually derived from a Ukranian New Year
song [Shchedryk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shchedryk_(song)). I
found the original score on
[IMSLP](https://imslp.org/wiki/File:PMLP308563-Leontovych-Shchedryk.pdf)
and used the first 32 bars as the theme. The last 8 bars end the final
variation. Background on each varation follows.

1. This is just a basic elaboration of the theme, with more complex
counterpoint. Note that the odd variations are polyphonic and the even
ones homophonic.

2. This is itself a chaconne, a continuous variation form which was
another option for the assignment. The chord progression is E♭-B♭-c-g
from the theme.

3. I realized when starting this assignment that *Shchedryk* has the
exact same melody as one my other favorite songs, the [Dies
Irae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dies_irae), but with a different
rhythm. The ground bass here consists of the first section of that piece,
taken from the score in the [Norton Anthology of Western
Music](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393656411).

4. This is a harmonic reduction (incomplete and possibily erroneous in
parts) of the original, done in the style of *Paganini* from
Schumann's [Carnaval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnaval_(Schumann)).

5. The final variation is a short fugue on the main theme, with the
original ending as a coda. When modulating to G major I was reminded
of another favorite Christmas song which I could not resist
incorporating.
